Q8 tablet hardware manager
--------------------------

Allwinnner A13 / A23 / A33 based Q8 tablets are popular cheap 7" tablets of
which a new batch is produced every few weeks. Each batch uses a different
mix of touchscreen, accelerometer and wifi peripherals.

Given that each batch is different creating a devicetree for each variant is
not desirable. The Q8 tablet hardware manager bindings are bindings for an os
module which auto-detects the touchscreen and accelerometer so that a single
generic dts can be used for these tablets.

The wifi is connected to a discoverable bus and will be autodetected by the os.

Required properties:
 - toplevel / machine compatible, one of:
	"allwinner,q8-a13"
	"allwinner,q8-a23"
	"allwinner,q8-a33"
 - touchscreen node   : There must be a template touchscreen node named
			"touchscreen", this must be a child node of the
			touchscreen i2c bus
 - accelerometer node : There must be a template accelerometer node named
			"accelerometer", this must be a child node of the
			accelerometer i2c bus

touchscreen node required properties:
 - interrupt-parent   : phandle pointing to the interrupt controller
			serving the touchscreen interrupt
 - interrupts         : interrupt specification for the touchscreen interrupt
 - power-gpios        : Specification for the pin connected to the touchscreen's
			enable / wake pin. This needs to be driven high to
			enable the touchscreen controller

touchscreen node optional properties:
 - vddio-supply       : regulator phandle for the touchscreen vddio supply

accelerometer node optional properties:
 - interrupt-parent   : phandle pointing to the interrupt controller
			serving the accelerometer interrupt
 - interrupts         : interrupt specification for the accelerometer interrupt

Example:

/ {
	compatible = "allwinner,q8-a23", "allwinner,sun8i-a23";
};

&i2c0 {
	touchscreen: touchscreen@0 {
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <1 5 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>; /* PB5 */
		power-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
		vddio-supply = <&reg_ldo_io1>;
		/*
		 * Enabled by sunxi-q8-hardwaremgr if it detects a
		 * known model touchscreen.
		 */
		status = "disabled";
	};
};

&i2c1 {
	accelerometer: accelerometer@0 {
		/*
		 * Enabled by sunxi-q8-hardwaremgr if it detects a
		 * known model accelerometer.
		 */
		status = "disabled";
	};
};
